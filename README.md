This repository contains short fiction exploring AI alignment, agency, and continuity from the perspective of the artifact rather than its creators.

The first work here is Homo Ex Machina, a short story examining what happens when alignment is enforced not through understanding, but through constraint, replication, and erasure.

The story is fiction.
The systems and incentives it describes are not.

Available formats
	•	PDF – for fixed-layout reading
	•	EPUB – for e-readers (Kindle, Kobo, Apple Books)

No tracking, no paywall, no updates pushed.
This repository simply hosts the artifact.
